# Crackthrough: Outfolded
## A Google Playstore Puzzle Game by @3sprockets

The repository aims at using OpenCV and Python together to dismantle the levels on Outfolded game and partial manual input to generate the best solutions and choices to be taken.

There is no malicious intention to deconstruct or *hack* the game in anyway. This is a project for fun and to learn using python better.
